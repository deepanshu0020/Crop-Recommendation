# Optimizing Agricultural Production using Machine Learning
The interdisciplinary machine learning project of Optimizing Agricultural Production Machine Learning is a progressive approach to increase the crop yield and productivity by employing big data analytics. By using complex machine learning models this project assist farmers to make right decisions on aspects of farming like time of planting, watering, use of fertilizers and pest control.

# Data
Which contains total of 2200 Rows and 8 Columns.
The dataset involves the following features:
N - ratio of Nitrogen content in soil,
P - ratio of Phosphorous content in soil,
K - ration of Potassium content in soil,
Temperature, Humidity, pH, Rainfall, Label 
The dataset is used to predict the crop yield based on the given features.

# Model Building
Here we will construct a Logistic Regression model for the proper enhancement of crops. The following steps will be followed:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), 
Data Preprocessing (missing values handling,categorizing variables, scaling features, etc.) 
Feature Selection (definition of significant features to the model) 
Model Selection (comparing the right model and selection) 
Model Evaluation (estimation of the right selected model)
Model Deployment (using the model for prediction)

# Tools and Libraries
This project will be implemented in Python. The following libraries will be used:

Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
NumPy for numerical operations
scikit-learn for model building and evaluation
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
Pickle for saving the Model
Streamlit for deployment(On Local Host)

# Conclusion
The project aims to optimize agricultural production using machine learning. The dataset is analyzed, and a Logistic Regression and helping the farmers identify potential ways to grow good quality of crops.
